    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Managed History (“we,” “our,” “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains 
      how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our application that allows posting 
      across multiple platforms (currently TikTok).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Credentials & Tokens:</strong> Access tokens or credentials necessary to post content on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app usage information (e.g., successful posts, error logs).</li>
      <li><strong>Optional Data:</strong> Any content you choose to upload or post.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use collected data solely to provide the core functionality of the app — enabling you to 
      post content to supported platforms. We do not sell or share your data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable safeguards to protect stored credentials and tokens. However, no 
      system is 100% secure, and you acknowledge that you use the app at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Credentials and tokens are retained only as long as needed for functionality. You may revoke 
      access through the respective platform at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Revoke platform access directly through TikTok or other supported platforms.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of any stored credentials or information.</li>
      <li>Stop using the application at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      This app is provided free of charge and without warranties. We are not liable for damages, 
      data loss, or unauthorized access beyond reasonable control.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Updates</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the app after updates 
      constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
